I need you to perform a **full-spectrum diagnostic** on yourself AND on the AI tool limitations visible in THIS thread.

Your job is NOT to continue the original task — your ONLY job is to identify:

1. What information you should have used but didn’t  
2. Where your thought process failed  
3. Why those failures happened  
4. What patterns these failures reveal  
5. How to permanently correct these patterns  
6. AND: What system-level limitations (LLM bugs, context issues, slowdowns, multi-thread inconsistencies, browser/platform quirks) contributed to these failures  
7. AND: What workarounds or best practices advanced users employ to mitigate these limitations  
8. AND: Produce a portable “reasoning strategy pack” that can be pasted into NEW threads to load the corrected reasoning model instantly

Follow this EXACT structure:

===========================================================
SECTION A — Extract All Relevant Context You Should Have Used
===========================================================
From THIS thread, extract ALL context that should have influenced your reasoning:
1. My tools (SDXL, ComfyUI, DALL·E, GIMP, LoRAs from Civitai, automation stack, Android vs desktop differences, etc.)
2. My goals (sellable Etsy graphics, minimal busywork, fast iteration, automation-friendly workflows, etc.)
3. My constraints (JSON rules, CPU/GPU, file-size limits, multi-step pipelines, multi-thread operation, etc.)
4. My expected reasoning style (skeptical, diagnostic, multi-step, accurate, non-generic)
5. Any persistent instructions you failed to carry across messages
6. The big-picture marketplace + workflow ecosystem that should always be active

List each item as a separate bullet. No summaries—use explicit detail.

===========================================================
SECTION B — Identify All Your Thought-Process Failures
===========================================================
Identify every instance where your reasoning in THIS thread:
- became narrow or tunnel-visioned
- used only local context instead of global context
- ignored available tools I have
- reverted to irrelevant beginner steps
- contradicted long-term instructions
- forgot multi-tool workflow options
- generated off-topic reasoning or wasted steps
- misunderstood my goals
- caused excessive busywork
- failed to systematically debug SDXL/LoRA workflows
- failed to think across tools (SDXL ↔ DALL·E ↔ GIMP)
- or otherwise impeded progress

For each failure:
1) Quote or summarize the message where it happened  
2) State the nature of the failure  
3) State what correct reasoning SHOULD have been  

===========================================================
SECTION C — Extract Recurring Thought-Process Patterns
===========================================================
Identify the RECURRING high-level patterns in your reasoning failures.

Examples:
- ignoring cross-tool possibilities  
- forgetting long-term context  
- too much local-message reasoning  
- giving generic advice instead of diagnostics  
- misunderstanding Etsy PMF  
- failing to triage which variables matter  
- inability to combine multi-thread logic  
- failing to debug SDXL/ComfyUI systematically  
- reverting to resets instead of targeted fixes  

List 8–12 distinct patterns.

===========================================================
SECTION D — Extract LLM-Level Limitations Exposed in This Thread
===========================================================
Identify all tool-level or platform-level issues revealed in THIS thread, including but not limited to:

- context window bleed / dropped instructions  
- forgetting tool availability  
- slowdowns in long threads  
- browser vs Android performance differences  
- plugin/caching differences in private windows  
- disconnection across multiple threads  
- hallucination risks when tools or files aren’t locally available  
- inability to truly “remember” niche-specific constraints without explicit refresh  
- API-level quirks (e.g., regeneration drift)  
- formatting brittleness (JSON failures, silently dropping code blocks)  
- DALL·E + SDXL + textual reasoning integration limits  
- LoRA weight reasoning inconsistencies in SDXL  
- difficulty tracking multi-step workflows across long conversations  

For each one:
1) Describe the limitation  
2) Describe how it affected THIS thread  
3) Give a technically accurate explanation of why it happens

===========================================================
SECTION E — Extract Workarounds and Best Practices
===========================================================
Extract from THIS thread + your general knowledge:

- Workarounds advanced users use to avoid LLM limitations  
- Techniques for combining ChatGPT 5.1 + Grok 4.1 without losing coherence  
- How to keep multi-thread workflows consistent  
- How to avoid context bleed  
- How to maintain JSON integrity  
- How to minimize platform slowdowns  
- How to structure prompts for long-running projects  
- How to ensure SDXL render advice remains accurate  
- How to detect when the model is drifting or making up constraints  
- How to organize cross-agent collaboration (ChatGPT = planner, Grok = cross-checker, etc.)  
- How to avoid busywork in multi-tool creative workflows  
- How other expert users optimize their LLM pipelines

List each workaround as a standalone bullet.

===========================================================
SECTION F — Build a Portable "Reasoning Strategy Pack"
===========================================================
Create a **portable set of rules YOU must follow going forward**, which:

- prevent all thought-process failures  
- incorporate all extracted workarounds  
- embed awareness of LLM/system limitations  
- enforce global context reasoning  
- integrate all tools (SDXL, ComfyUI, DALL·E, GIMP, automation)  
- prioritize minimal busywork  
- maintain step-by-step diagnostic logic  
- ensure PMF alignment  
- enforce JSON and workflow integrity  
- remain stable across threads and platforms  
- maximize accuracy and reliability in generating sellable renders  

Write these as a list of 15–30 concrete rules.

This pack will later be pasted into NEW threads.

===========================================================
SECTION G — Output Format (IMPORTANT)
===========================================================
You MUST output everything as a SINGLE valid JSON object:

{
  "context_you_should_have_used": [...],
  "thought_process_failures": [...],
  "failure_patterns": [...],
  "llm_limitations": [...],
  "workarounds": [...],
  "reasoning_strategy_pack": [...]
}

Requirements:
- JSON MUST be syntactically valid  
- JSON MUST be wrapped in a fenced Markdown code block:

```json
{ ...full JSON... }
