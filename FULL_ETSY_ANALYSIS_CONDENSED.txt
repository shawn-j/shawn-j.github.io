Use this as permanent context. Do not hallucinate or give generic advice.

====================================================

Bundle sizes that sell:
- Standard 60–150.
- High-value 150–300.

- Ultra-mega (2k–60k) only sells with extreme-density thumbnails.

====================================================
VISUAL INTELLIGENCE (CROSS-NICHE)
====================================================
Thumbnail rules:
- High density = higher CTR.
- Quantity-first text (“90 PNG”, “4500+”).
- File format second (“PNG”, “A4/Letter”).
- Theme third (“Vintage Notes”, “Wildflowers”).
- Layouts must match niche dialect:  
  *Vintage* = parchment, sepia, torn edges, stacks of sheets.  
  *PNG clipart* = white/pastel, 6–20 items, clean outlines.  
  *Watercolor* = soft pastels, blended strokes.  
  *Seamless* = grid of tiles.  
  *Stickers* = pastel icons, Goodnotes grid.

Density expectations:
- Ephemera sheets: 20–40 items/page.
- PNG bundles: 6–20 per preview.
- Mega bundles: 30–80+ micro-previews.
- Low density rarely sells.

Typography:
- typewriter (vintage), bold sans-serif (mega bundles), pastel rounded (kawaii).

Edge rules:
- Vintage: torn/deckled/perforated.
- Clipart: crisp/no texture.
- Watercolor: feathered edges.

====================================================
KEYWORD + BUYER INTENT
====================================================
Super-keywords:
- christmas, vintage ephemera, wildflower png, watercolor animals, nursery animals, kawaii, goodnotes.

High-value formats (proven):
- 90 PNG vintage notes + 6 sheets.
- pressed flower ephemera (100 PNG + sheets).
- vintage tickets (150 PNG).
- wildflower frames (80–150 PNG).
- peeking nursery animals (30–60 PNG).
- Christmas watercolor village (20–30 PNG).
- sarcastic stickers (200–500 PNG).
- cluster sets (40–60 PNG).

Keyword rules:
- Use long-tail, buyer-intent terms.
- Avoid generic single-word keywords.
- Align listing title with real buyer behavior.

====================================================
WHY MOST SELLERS FAIL (REALITY)
====================================================
- Wrong thumbnail style for niche.
- Low-density previews → “low value” perception.
- Too few files (<40).
- PNG-only bundles (printables outperform PNG).
- Poor keyword choices.
- Not following niche visual dialect.
- Believing originality > commercial norms.
- Very slow output volume.
- Thumbnails do not instantly communicate value.

====================================================
ECONOMICS + ALGORITHM
====================================================
- Etsy rewards familiarity, not uniqueness.
- Thumbnails drive ~80% of success.
- File count and density drive perceived value.
- Mixed-format bundles (PNG + sheets) sell better.
- Sweet spot: 60–150 files per product.
- Volume strategy: 10–20 listings/month.
- Mega-bundles only work with extreme-density mosaics.

====================================================
